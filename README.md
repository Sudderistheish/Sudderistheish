 READ.ME 301-LAB-08

**Author**: ANDREA MALONE
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

Do a formal code review of each person’s code (10 minutes each).
Open your partner’s GitHub pull request on your laptop.
Identify an area in the code that:
you don’t understand
or seems overly complex
or you see a way to improve
or you want more information on
or you really like or think is interesting

I did a code review with Jusing Agim and Ajamu Page.
I explain the issues I had with my lab 7.  I express to them the issue with my code and what mistakes I made while trying to write the application. 
I explain my sticking points and pain points and bounced ideas of them to confirm if they experience the same.  Each had different feedback to offer and approaches they used
to try and write their code. It was interesting hearing different ways and ideas on how to get the code to appear. 

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
